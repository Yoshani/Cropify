# Cropify

A Flutter and GetX project for easing the task of farmers claiming compensation from the government for crop damages. Cropify is a mobile phone app-based replacement to the conventional paper-based method used by Sri Lankan farmers to apply for compensation from the government in situations where their crops are fully or partially destroyed due to events such as wild elephant attacks, pests, floods, and droughts. Thus, the system involves a bespoke system designed especially to suit the requirements of the two main end user parties: farmers and government officers, for easy execution of the process of compensation application and the subsequent claim review process solely through the application.

## Key Features
- User login as Farmer (officer logs in with admin provided credentials)
- Farmer and officer registration
- Guaranteeing of a single user account per government registered farm
- Logging compensation claim details
- Photo and video proof upload using both Camera and Gallery
- Claim progression history view
- View of list of claims to be checked
- Secure payment transaction handling for compensation payments
- Notify farmers about claim status completion through popup notification
